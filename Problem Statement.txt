1. Write a program that would do heap sort - sort them in ascending order.

a. make an array of at least 15 random numbers.

b. Make a heap of that array.

c. Sort the array using heap sort.

You will submit the readme file with information on what platform you used and how to compile it

Output:

execution screen shot showing:

a. initial array of random numbers showing the index in the array and the number stored in that index

b. array after the heap has been made (same as before .. index and the number in that index)

c. sorted array.
